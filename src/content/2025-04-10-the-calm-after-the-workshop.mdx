summary: "How to recover from the chaos of a workshop and reflect on the growth that comes from it."
---


In my current client engagement, we're in a period of change, chaos, and growth. The organisation is transforming itself into a digital organisation with Product and Tech at its core, and part of that involves a lot of high-pace, high-chaos workshops – think *hackathon-meets-design-sprint-meets-stakeholder-showcase*. Each day is filled with rapid problem definition, alignment exercises, ideation, fast-paced development, customer interviews, and feedback sessions from highly-engaged stakeholders who are deeply invested in the outcomes.

This will be the shape of my work for the next few months, at least, and in the stretched out, calmer moments the day after a frantic workshop, I'm reflecting on how we can improve on it and make it sustainable.

## Building in recovery time
Maybe it's just because it's not what I do every day, but I find workshop facilitation to be an energy-intensive exercise. Managing expectations, designing and adapting a day's schedule, keeping people focused while capturing emergent concerns, prioritising said concerns... all while keeping to the agreed timeframe for the day. It feels like running on adrenaline for 9 hours, and it can be very hard to come down from that energy at the end of a day.

In the days after a workshop, I find it necessary to have quiet, structure, and slack time. In the same way that after a race, athletes need time for their muscles to recover, my brain and endocrine system need time to go back to regular programming. After a high-intensity sprint, like you might have in a workshop, hackathon, launch period, etc., I find it often takes longer or feels harder to do pretty basic things. Also there's usually a few loose ends to tie up, things to document, or follow-up tasks to be done. As a result, I will try to ensure that the day or two after are low-key and high-structure, to protect my frazzled neural pathways.

## Reflecting on growth

Just like with a high-intensity fitness program, there are definite benefits to these high-chaos moments in my work week. While I wouldn't want this to be the pace of my everyday, I am noticing that I am improving at my craft quite quickly. Just a few of the things I've noticed:

- I'm learning quickly, and becoming more competent in my craft, because there's just so much happening on each workshop day.
- I'm also becoming more confident in my skills, because I am teaching and coaching others.
- I'm getting fast feedback in the areas that I need to improve, and positive feedback in the areas that I am doing well.
- My team are forming a strong bond – we have needed to come together quickly, and learn each others' rhythms, and as a result we're stronger than ever.
- There are definite moments of fun and excitement, amongst the chaos.

 What I am hyper aware of is the risk of burnout. If that recovery time isn't built into the process, I think it would be very easy to lose those benefits, and just associate the workshopping with exhaustion. On the other hand, giving myself (and everyone involved in the process) some recovery time ensures that they can not only recover, but also reflect on the positive moments.
