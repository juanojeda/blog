Over the past few weeks, I've been on a kick to build a habit of writing more frequently. I think it's working, and I've been reflecting on why.

1. **Lowering the bar on word count**: There's no rules about how much or how little you're allowed to write. I took some inspiration from my old colleague and friend Tom Gamon (aka [tomgamon.com](https://tomgamon.com/)), and let myself off the hook when it comes to allowing myself to write less, in the interest of writing more often.
2. **Not everything needs to be published**: Sometimes I get the urge to write something, then when I read it back, I realise it's not quite for the public â€“ yet, or maybe ever. That's ok. I'm allowed to just build a habit.
3. **Having an easy setup to write with**: They say a bad artist blames their brushes, but I can tell you that it's much more enjoyable to paint with good tools. For me, having a solid Obsidian setup for my writing has made a big difference (maybe that's an idea for something to write about another day).
4. **Having somewhere I'm proud to post**: Similar to the above, it's much more motivating to write if I think people might read my stuff, or at least that there is somewhere I'm proud to put it out there. Building this site over the past few weeks has made me excited to fill it with content, so that's a big plus.
