As I'm wrapping up on my current client engagement this week, I keep reflecting back on an analogy that a previous manager would often use:

> Teams are like immutable functions in fp. If you change the inputs, they're no longer the same team[^heavily-paraphrased]

To understand this analogy, you have to understand a bit about Functional Programming (FP) â€“ which, in the team this manager was leading, was the programming ideology of choice. In FP, functions are idempotent: given a consistent set of inputs, they will produce the same output. Conversely, if you change a set of inputs, the function's output will be different.

While I don't know how far we can stretch the analogy, for some reason this one really tickled my brain. I hope you'll forgive my rudimentary understanding of FP concepts, but this is how the analogy works in my head:

1. Teams are a function of the people, and
2. Teams are a function of their context, and
3. New teams need time to form

### 1. Teams are a function of the people

We can consider each team member to be a distinct input. Consider a set of team members **A**licia, **B**ec, and **C**harlie who are put into a group to work on a business initiative. Over time, A,B and C will go through the stages of team development (ie. Forming, Storming, Norming and Performing)[^Tuckman's-stages], they will begin to produce predictable outputs, and for all intents and purposes, we can consider them a single identity - Team ABC.

If Alicia is replaced by Danilo, we no longer have a Team ABC, but we will (eventually) have Team BCD. The inputs have changed, and therefore the team is now distinct, and needs to undergo the same forming process all over again. We shouldn't be surprised when we replace one member with another (even with the same skills, similar company context, etc) and the team goes through a few hiccups. They are a _new_ team, and they need to form their identity.

### 2. Teams are a function of their context

We can also consider that teams don't operate in a vacuum, and that the broader context also forms part of the team's inputs. For instance the team's business objective forms a critical part of their identity, and a change of business direction could effectively create a distinct version of the team. The same goes for relationships to other highly dependant teams, mission-critical tooling or systems, or other contextual inputs. Different inputs mean different outputs.

People also operate in their own personal contexts. A promotion, new certification, or major life event could be enough to constitute a change of inputs. And different inputs mean different outputs.

While this might seem like a bit of a stretch of the analogy, I find this framing useful when debugging team issues. If I notice signs that a seemingly stable team is going through the tell-tale signs of Forming or Storming, I start to look for other contextual inputs that might have changed.

### 3. New teams need time to form

This isn't a framework or methodology for leadership, or anything like that, but it's something that sticks in my mind. Every time I notice something that I consider to be a change of inputs, I try to remember that new teams need time and space to form their identity, before they begin to really work together.

There are ways to speed up this forming process, and there are probably even ways to reduce the disruption caused by changes of input (team charters, personal FAQs, ways of working sessions, etc.), or ways of making the change more obvious[^semver-for-teams]. But to me this is more about recognising that a team is really just a collection of people in a context, and if the people or context change, the team also changes.
