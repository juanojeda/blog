summary: "Reflections on a workshop I led on customer interviews and design research."
---

This week I had the opportunity to guide a workshop on rapid discovery, design, prototyping, customer research and iteration, and I observed a few things.

1. **There are different types of design research questions, and they require different types of tools to answer them.** Some questions need broader, more qualitative treatment (such as "why does my customer do x?"), while others lend themselves to more precise, quantitative tools (such as "which of these variations will drive customers to add more widgets to their cart?"). I have more reading to do about this subject, but I'm sure there's a model for this.
2. **It's so helpful to start out with a clear and focused research objective.** When your objective is "Does this design work?", there's a lot of ways you can fall short. But when your objective is based on a clear hypothesis (eg. "We believe that customers aren't adding items to their bag because they can't see the button. We think that if we make the button bigger, they will add it to their bag" ) and aims to test that hypothesis, it gives you a clearer understanding of "why" and "what next".
3. **When you start with a design solution in mind, it's very hard to form your customer research questions.** It's very easy to fall into a trap of trying to justify your design decisions, or lead the customer to answer the questions in the way you want. It's far better to start from a point of curiosity, or to try to disprove your hypothesis, because that's the only way you can get confidence in your solution.
