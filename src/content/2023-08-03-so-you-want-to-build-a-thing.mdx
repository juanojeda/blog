Recently, a friend asked one of the questions that is asked so often of software developers, web designers, digital creators, and makers of all kinds. This question comes in some shape or form of the following:

> How much would it cost to build this website, or something similar to it?

It's often a question that many hate to field, and will often ignore, avoid, or brush off with some excuse or another.

# So many ways to ask the same question

This question comes in so many forms. Sometimes they give examples or inspo:

> How much would it cost to build a website? I've got some examples…

Sometimes they give a bit of a purpose to the project:

> I'm about to start my own dental clinic. How much would it cost to build a website?

Or sometimes if we're lucky (and I mean that honestly), they provide a bit of a ballpark figure:

> Can I build something like this for $1000 — $2000?

At the core of the question often is a complex, indeterminate length of yarn, wrapped up into a tight, and sometimes knotty, ball. If you've gotten this kind of ball before, you know it's a lot of work just to unravel it and measure it, let alone do anything useful with it.

Sometimes when you're asked this question, it feels easier to just say “I don't know”, “I am not taking on extra work right now”, or throw out a large figure, in the hopes that they either go away, or pay you to answer. But the problem is that you might lose customers, or worse — they pay you before you know what you're signing up for! But to me, the worst part of this kind of reaction is that you miss out on an opportunity to show people a more helpful way to ask this question.

# A better way to ask

If you're on the receiving end of a question like this and you want to do more than shrug it away, or if you've asked this question and you received a less-than-ideal response, here are a few tips that might help turn that complex ball of yarn into a productive set of requirements, ready for measuring, cutting, and working.

## 1. Tell me your goals

By far, the biggest problem with the above format of question is that it gives almost no context to what problems you're trying to solve, and puts the onus on me, the receiver, to unpack it before I can answer. If you're lucky, I might have time to sit down and ask the important questions so that I can start to answer your main question. But if not, you might end up being brushed off without a real answer.

On the other hand, if you tell me roughly what you want your website, app, or widget to do, it's going to be much easier to answer your question. I might still have some follow-up questions to narrow the scope, but this will be more productive than starting from scratch.

Instead of asking:

> “How much will it cost to build this website? I have an example”,

try asking like this:

> “I want a website that can tell people about my band, lets me tell them about upcoming gigs, and email me for gig bookings. How much would that cost?”

## 2. Tell me what is fixed and what is flexible

The next concern with the original question is that it gives me no indication of the importance of the features you are asking for, the problems they solve, or the compromises you're willing to make. Again, if you're lucky, you'll have someone ask follow-up questions to figure this out for you, but this isn't guaranteed.

If you want a better chance at getting a good answer the first time, you can build on the above format by telling me the _relative importance_ of each problem you need to solve. Which solution is crucial to the survival of your business, and which is a nice-to-have?

This can sometimes be very hard to unpack, because subjectively, all of our problems can feel like the most important. But sometimes we can use an off-the-shelf solution, or sometimes the solution just isn't worth the cost. Knowing your list of priorities will help to allocate time and resources in to the most important problems.

Instead of asking this:

> I'm about to start my own dental clinic. How much would it cost to build a website?

Try asking like this:

> I'd like a website for my dental clinic. The most important part is that people can find it on Google, and get in touch. It'd be great (but not essential) if they could book appointments online. Bonus points if they can use a referral code, but this is my lowest priority.

## 3. Tell me your budget

From talking to clients, especially those who are new to digital services, or who are early on in their exploration process, it seems like price is a very sensitive subject. It can feel very vulnerable to put your wallet on the table and say “what can I get with this?”, and the concern is that a dishonest person will effectively take the money and run, giving you a bad deal.

Another problem might be that you just have no idea how much you need to invest, or whether you can afford to take on this project! If you've never paid for a type of product or service, it's going to be really hard to come up with a ballpark figure. That's okay, and that's probably why you're asking in the first place!

However, if you do have some idea of what you're willing to pay right now, putting that information up front can be helpful in getting a solid answer. Having a price range to play with can help filter out prohibitively expensive solutions, and when combined with a well-prioritised list of problems, it can even help identify areas to compromise. Additionally, if you can connect the price with the value that it'll bring to your initiative, that makes it much easier to define a solution. Of course, sometimes your expectations might not match what your providers can provide, but putting this information up front makes that conversation easier to have.

Instead of asking like this:

> Can I build something like this for $1000 — $2000?

Try asking like this:

> I have between $3000 — $5000, and I want a website to be able to sell my t-shirts. My main priority is for people to be able to see the t-shirts and order them. Second priority would be to be able to do payments and shipping online. If I could do discount codes within that $5000 range, that would be excellent, but not a deal breaker. Is this possible?

# Ask right, and you just might receive

Hopefully, I've given you a better way to ask for help with the next thing you want to make. And if you're a maker yourself, next time someone asks, try asking them to reframe their question with these tips — maybe you'll end up with a set of well-defined, clearly-defined problems that you're excited to solve!
