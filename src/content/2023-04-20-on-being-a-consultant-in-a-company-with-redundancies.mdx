_Written in the midst of a round of organisational changes. The dust is still settling, but these were my thoughts and feelings at the time._

Today, the company at which I'm consulting announced that they've made a difficult decision. They've been working very hard to avoid this decision — doubling down on things that work, testing new avenues for revenue, being creative with marketing spend, trimming unnecessary operational costs. It hasn't been enough, and they have had to make redundancies.

Going through this experience in an organisation is never easy, no matter which side of that decision you're on, which email you're receiving, or what logo is on your payslip.

Yesterday afternoon, my team — some from Everest, some from in-house, all on the same team — had a candid chat, speculating about the Town Hall meeting booked for this morning, what might happen, and how we should deal with the fall out if the worst was to happen. It became clear that we'd all been seeing this elephant in our periphery, but for whatever reason — wanting to spare our friends the anxiety, not wanting to make the shadow a reality, maybe something else — we'd never acknowledged it in the open. Knowing we were all seeing and feeling the same things helped.

Today, as I sip my coffee, I am watching the Slack updates drip through. A message of support. An offer of a chat or an ear to listen. A brief goodbye. A sad and heartfelt “thanks for the opportunity”, and a request to keep in touch. Some from people I've never met, others from people who I've admired and looked up to. Some from close colleagues. From friends. I flip between wanting to pull myself away from these notifications, and needing the uncertainty to be over.

A couple of months ago, after seeing some friends' posts in my LinkedIn feed about their redundancies, I noticed that bubble in my chest expanding. I was worried and anxious — for myself, for my colleagues, for my friends and family. I could feel the gnawing of paranoia starting to creep in, telling me that the decision that would affect me was just around the corner. I spoke to my mentor at Everest, as well as my colleagues on the same account. We shared our thoughts about how we could support our client and our in-house coworkers, as they navigated through a lot of uncertainty. We spoke openly about what might happen if our engagement was cut short. We didn't have any real answers, but knowing that we were in it together helped.

The rest of today is probably going to be slow and void of the work we're used to doing, as we make space for people to reflect, absorb, grieve, and adjust to this altered state of reality. I'm struggling with what one colleague referred to as “survivor's guilt”, as well as this odd feeling of obligation as a consultant; that I need to deliver even more value now, to somehow make up for this. I'm struggling with how to say farewell to some people from whom I've learnt so much. I'm also wondering how I can be the best support for my peers around me — those that got The Email, and those that didn't.

After chatting with one of my mentors at Everest, I'm also reminded that change, uncertainty, and the unexpected are all part of the job for us consultants. We face change regularly, whether at the end of a short two-week gig, or as an 18 month partnership comes to its natural conclusion. When we're between roles, we deal with the uncertainty of what opportunities will come up next, of what challenges we'll face, and (if you're like many of the self-assessed imposters in the industry, myself included) wondering if we're up to the challenge. Some engagements end unexpectedly, for a whole range of reasons. For us consultants, the uncertainty is a regular part of the job that we learn to process, the longer we're exposed to it. We learn to view the ends as a transition, a chance to rest, to learn, or reassess our focus, while we wait for the next assignment. That safety, and the resilience it gives us, are luxuries we shouldn't take for granted.

We might not ship as much code today as normal. A lot of meetings have been cleared for the day, and probably more will be cleared for the rest of the week. Some projects and decisions we were working towards might wait until tomorrow, or next week. But that doesn't mean we've stopped working. We'll keep making space for people to feel, reflect, and adjust. We'll listen, and support each other. We'll praise each other's achievements publicly, and show that we're part of a team. All of this is the important work that makes a team more than the sum of its parts, and allows us to achieve great things, and ride out the harder times.

I don't have any answers, and everything still feels very uncertain. It probably will for a while. But I'm grateful for the amazing people I have around me, and those I've been lucky enough to have met so far. I'm grateful for the open conversations, and the small gestures that show we value each other. For those affected by redundancies, I hope that you can take time to rest, adjust, learn, or refocus. Remember that these decisions are not a reflection on your worth or value — you are valued. For those not directly affected, especially those who are consulting in an affected organisation, thank you for your kindness, and support for your colleagues, it doesn't go unnoticed. Look after yourself and each other, change is hard but the people around you are there to support you.
