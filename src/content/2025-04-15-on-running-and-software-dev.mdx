As a running enthusiast, I often find myself drawing comparisons between my fitness hobby and my profession. It's a highly accessible analogy â€“ not everybody runs for fitness and fun, and not everyone has the capability to run, but most people have, at some point in their lives, done some running.

One common comparison that I hear between running and software development (or work, projects, or life...) is "it's not a sprint, it's a marathon". The implication is about pacing yourself, and planning for a long journey, rather than over-committing your energy and burning out.

The thing I love about this analogy is that there are lots of similarities between software/product delivery and long-distance running. Here I'll list a few.

1. **Repetitions**: In software, and in distance running, you improve by getting in repetitions. By practicing the thing you want to be good at. If you want to be a great runner, practice by running. If you want to be better at delivering software, practice by delivering software.
2. **Shorter stride = consistency = faster pace**: Smaller steps take less energy, are less injury-prone, lead to more consistent pace, and make for faster finishes over time. This is true both in long-distance running and in software delivery. Just like a longer stride leads to higher risk of injury, a bigger unit of delivery leads to more assumptions, longer feedback cycles, and higher risk of burnout. Smaller units of delivery, on the other hand, optimise for regular feedback, and allow you to optimise for point 1 - repetitions.
3. **Practice slow and fast**: Practicing at different speeds strengthens different muscles and fitness systems, and teaches you how to adapt to your situation. Whether you're a runner or a software team, practicing at both fast pace (100m sprints, hackathons) and endurance pace (long distance, big initiatives) in an intentional manner, will give you skills that you can apply to adapt when you need to, as well as a greater awareness of your capabilities and limits.
4. **Recovery is vital**: Just like with running, you can't expect to maintain peak software delivery fitness if you're always at 100% output. Allowing time for recovery is just as important, if not more important, than the intensity of your repetitions. Which leads to my final point.
5. **Reflection leads to awareness**: Regular reflection on your performance leads to self awareness, and self awareness can lead to improvement (if you have the tools and the right attitude!). This one is more of a meta-analogy, but I'm including it as a running analogy, because all the elite running athletes talk about reflecting on performance - not just from the stats perspective (pace, distance, heart rate, etc), but also mindset and inner reflection. I think this is a pretty valuable tip to take into your work too, and can give you insight into the patterns and situations that cause you discomfort, as well as the ones you thrive in.
