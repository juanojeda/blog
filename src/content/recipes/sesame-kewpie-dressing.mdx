## Ingredients

- 6 tbsps kewpie, or other mayonnaise [^kewpie-sub]
- 2 tbsps Soy Sauce
- 2 tbsps Rice Wine Vinegar
- 2 tbsps Chinese Cooking Wine
- 2 tbsps Mirin
- 2 tsps Sesame Oil
- 3 tsps Sesame Seeds

## Method

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix well.

## Variations

- **Ginger**: Add 1 tsp of finely grated ginger to the dressing for an extra kick.
- **Sriracha**: Add up to 2 tbsps of sriracha for some funky spice. This goes really well with grilled fish or chicken.

[^kewpie-sub]: If you don't have access to kewpie, go for a whole-egg mayonnaise that leans more savoury than sweet (I like S&W, but Tomy or Hellman's also works). This recipe also works with [my mayonnaise](/recipes/mayonnaise) as a base.
