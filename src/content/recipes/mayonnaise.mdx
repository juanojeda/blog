## Ingredients

- 1 egg, whole
- 2 egg yolks
- approx. 1 cup of good oil \*(I prefer EVOO, but you can use a lighter-flavoured oil) [^oil]
- Juice of 1 1/2 lemon or limes
- zest of 1 lemon or lime
- 1-2 of garlic, chopped finely _(depending on how garlicky you like it)_
- Salt, to taste

## Method

1. Beat the eggs with a stick mixer, hand mixer or food processor until well combined, approx. 2 mins.
2. While continuing to beat the eggs, begin to add the oil in a slow, thin stream.
3. When the mayonnaise begins to reach a thick consistency, slowly add the lime juice until well combined.
4. Add the garlic and pulse until well combined.
5. Add salt in small amounts and pulse to combine, tasting as you go, until it tastes right.

## Variations

- **Herb mayonnaise**: Add about 1/4 cup of your favourite finely chopped herbs (coriander, dill and tarragon work particularly well) to the mayonnaise when you add the garlic.
- **French mayonnaise**: Add 2 tsp of dijon or whole grain mustard at the start, when you blend your eggs. Omit half the garlic.

[^oil]: You can use any oil you like, but I like to use a lightly-flavoured extra virgin olive oil. You can also mix oils if you find that all EVOO is too strongly flavoured.
