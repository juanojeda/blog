## Ingredients

- 3 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 heaped tbsp coffee beans, ground
- 1 tbsp cumin seed
- 1 tbsp coriander seed
- 1 tbsp fennel seed
- 1/2 tsp ancho chilli powder
- 1/2 tsp chipotle chilli powder
- 1/2 tsp cayenne chilli powder
- 1/2 tsp chilli flakes

## Method

Add ingredients to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, and grind until you get the consistency you want - somewhere between cracked pepper and coarse sand. I like to keep it a bit more coarse, to create a nice crust on the meat.
Store in an airtight container in a cool, dark place for up to 3 months.
