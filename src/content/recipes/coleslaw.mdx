## Ingredients

##### Base

- 3 cups red and green cabbage, chopped finely
- 1 cup carrot, shredded
- 1 green apple, shredded or chopped finely

##### Dressing

- 1/4 cup spring onion, chopped finely
- 1/4 cup coriander, chopped finely
- 1 red chili, chopped finely _(I like Bird's Eye chili, but a Thai red, or 1/2 long cayenne would also work)_
- 1/4 cup [homemade mayonnaise](/recipes/mayonnaise)[^mayo-sub]
- 1 lime, juice and zest (optional)[^lime]

## Method

1. _(optional step)_ Soak the cabbage in cold water for 5 minutes, then drain and spin or pat dry. Apart from cleaning the cabbage, it also helps to crisp up the strands of cabbage, and gives it a nice volume.
2. Combine the dressing ingredients in a bowl, and mix well.
3. Add in the base ingredients, and toss until the cabbage is well coated.

[^mayo-sub]: Home made mayonnaise really makes this recipe what it is, but if you don't have time or inclination, you can use a store bough mayonnaise. My favourite brand is S&W, but Tomy or Hellman's are also good.

[^lime]: If you're using my recipe for home-made mayonnaise, you may not need this as it's already quite limey. If you use a store bought mayonnaise, add a bit of lime juice, and season to taste.
