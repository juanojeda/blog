As a software practitioner and tech lead, I am often faced with the challenge of taking a set of business requirements and translating them into working software. In order to do this, there is a step that involves breaking down the bigger picture into discrete pieces that can be built, tested and delivered. There are many challenges in this process — from right-sizing the work, to sequencing for business value, to knowing when to break out research tasks, and more. In my opinion, it's in this process that the high-performing teams really stand out from the rest.

Slicing up work has become a bit of a favourite topic in software delivery for me over the past few years, and I am always keen to learn how to improve my practice. This is why over the last few months I've been getting more involved with the Everest Academy workshops offered by Everest Engineering. Last Friday, I helped my colleague Dan Prager deliver the workshop titled **Slicing Strategies for Successful Software Development**. We delivered the course for a group of eager software practitioners and leaders from Coles, CMC Markets, Jetstar, Our Community, Tech Leading Ladies, Thoughtworks, as well as a colleague from Everest.

One participant gave this session some amazing feedback:

I agree with her, and here's why.

# Overview of the workshop

[**Slicing Strategies for Successful Software Development**](https://www.everest.engineering/academy-offering/slicing-strategies-for-successful-software-development) is a full-day workshop with a good mix of theory, practical application, real-world stories and examples. (See the other workshops on offer at the [Everest Academy](https://www.everest.engineering/academy) page).

The morning session is lovingly borrowed from [Alistair Cockburn's Elephant Carpaccio workshop](https://alistaircockburn.com/Elephant-Carpaccio) — it covers definitions of slicing, why we do it, and then promptly throws the participants into some hands-on exercises to break down a set of requirements, and build them, all in about two and a half hours. After the adrenaline and heart rates have started to come down again, we debrief on our learnings, and discuss some of the challenges to implementing slicing.

The afternoon session takes a bird's eye view, and takes the principles of slicing and applies it to all levels of business, with an aim to give participants an extensive toolkit. We look at:

- the strategic, macro-level initiatives (think “How do I bring my bricks-and-mortar business into the digital world?”) with capability slicing.
- several strategies for the more familiar functional slicing sphere (think “How do I turn this user journey into a series of deliverable releases?”), and
- a quick overview of the many strategies to slice at the implementation level (think “how do I build a sales calculator in iterative slices?”) Followed by another hands-on exercise, this time letting participants bring their own real-world projects to slice, using the method they deem most appropriate.

# Learning by doing and reflecting

One of my favourite things about facilitating this workshop is seeing the “a-ha” moments happen around the room as they start to understand the why and how of slicing. This is possible because of the emphasis on hands-on exercises, and providing a safe environment to try new techniques, make mistakes, and discuss what we learn.

Because the exercises are done over a short period of time, and the participants are learning techniques or ideas that are new to them, it sometimes leads to unexpected results or mistakes. An example of this happened, where an ambitious group decided to try building their sales calculator with a pre-built user interface. We usually recommend avoiding UI implementations to reduce complexity, but the group was confident that their solution was simple enough, and they were able to progress quite quickly with it at first. Unfortunately, about halfway through the exercise they ran into some issues that halted their progress. Thankfully, because of the regular pair-swapping and review part of the exercise, the group had gathered some ideas about how they could adjust their design. They were able to pivot away from their ui-based solution without losing too much progress, and more importantly, the learnings from the post-exercise review were beneficial to the whole group.

# Key takeaways

I've been lucky to be able to participate in, and help facilitate, this workshop a handful of times now, and each time I think I leave with a stronger understanding of how to deliver value. This time around, the things I took from the session were:

- There are different types of value depending on your situation, and
- Smaller slices make it easier to learn and adapt

## There are different types of value depending on your situation

In the afternoon session, the participants were able to bring real-life examples of projects, to road-test their newly-learned slicing skills. In this session I saw first-hand that while not all projects are the same, the tools and techniques you use still broadly apply — if you understand what value you're trying to deliver.

For instance in our sales calculator example, we might define value as being able to make a single sale to one customer, charge them tax, and ship their product. But in a data warehouse platform consolidation project, the stakes and terminologies are a bit different. One participant brought an example like this, and their measure of business value was not in end-to-end usage of data, but in being able to switch off a data source. This slight difference in their definition of value allowed them to streamline their project delivery, and see value faster. So if you're able to understand the fundamental value your project is aiming to deliver, it is much easier to get to your thinnest slices.

## Smaller slices make it easier to learn and adapt

Apart from delivering value quickly, — and let's face it, if that's all we were doing, it would still be a huge improvement over the big-bang approach to delivery! — smalls slices give you lots of frequent opportunities to test ideas, learn from mistakes, and adapt to changes in your conditions.

Like the example earlier with the group who had to pivot away from a UI-based solution, most software teams will inevitably hit a speed-bump at some point in their careers that cause them to need to refactor, rearchitect, redesign, or reconsider. One of the benefits of smaller slices is that you have more opportunities to evaluate your position, and if the time comes, the potential loss of investment is smaller.

# Conclusion

Slicing up business requirements can be a daunting, confusing, or complex task, but in my opinion it's one of the critical steps in delivering value and being a high-performing team. Everest's **Slicing Strategies for Successful Software Development** workshop takes participants through a variety of tools and techniques, and shows them how to slice like pros. Through delivering the content, and sharing what we know about the different tools and methods for slicing work, I feel like I am learning more about slicing, and getting better at delivering value.

Oh, and the answer to the question in the title?

They're both great at delivering slices.
