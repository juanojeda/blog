I've been working on a technical evaluation task today, and I realised that while it's work that I am comfortable doing and I take it for granted, it's a skill I had to learn and a muscle I had to develop. I figured that someone might benefit from my approach to this, and that others might be able to offer suggestions on how to improve it.

This kind of work has a lot of different names from company to company - technical evaluation, options assessment, feasibility study, solution options, decision analysis â€“ but the purpose is essentially the same. You're looking at your options, and making a recommendation based on your criteria.

Here are the steps I take:

1. Identify the evaluation criteria
2. Brainstorm options to evaluate
3. Describe the options, assumptions and constraints
4. Compare the options against the criteria
5. Investigate gaps as necessary
6. Develop a recommendation
7. Socialise with stakeholders

### 1. Identify the evaluation criteria

Don't skip this step! Having a good idea of how I'll evaluate the options, and having alignment with the people it'll affect, makes all the difference.

Evaluation criteria could be things like:

- Cost
- Effort
- Time
- Change / operational impact
- Security / risk, etc

These are the factors that are important to my project, that determine whether the option is a valid selection or not. If I can, I try to prioritise my criteria because it makes evalation easier. If I'm not sure what sort of criteria to look at, this [list of system quality attributes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_system_quality_attributes) is where I start.

### 2. Brainstorm options to evaluate

This is usually where a lot of people usually start, but once again, don't skip step 1!

Here are my tips for brainstorming options:

- **Start with the status quo:** Doing nothing is always an option. Sometimes it's the best option.
- **Include the obvious options:** This one seems straightforward, but some options seem like they don't warrant further investigation. I try to include them anyway, because usually these are the first ones people ask about.
- **Include the options that I've mentally ruled out:** Sometimes I think options are very clear no's, but it's worth including them because in comparison, they might still be solid contenders, or they might prompt me to think about things differently. They might also be the one that someone else asks about, and I need to have an answer for why I've ruled it out.
- **Be pragmatic with how many options you investigate:** Seemingly contradictory to the above advice, I also try to be judicious about how many options I look at. More options means a more thorough analysis, but it also means more time evaluating. Some options may be very similar or provide minimal change to the status quo. I just need to be aware that people may ask why I didn't include them.

### 3. Describe the options, assumptions and constraints

Before digging into the comparison, I take the time to describe what each option looks like, including a high-level description, the assumptions I'm making (ie. the technology used, the process involved, etc), and any specifics that are out of scope for the option.

This step makes sure that anyone reviewing my evaluation or decision is on the same page as me, and also gives them the information they need to point out gaps in my evaluation.

I try to avoid any value judgements at this point, even if (especially if!) I feel there's already a strong contender. I'm just after clarity and facts at this point.

**Pro tip:** (thanks once again to [Tom Gamon](http://www.tomgamon.com) for this one!) I give my options a clear and memorable name. Instead of "Option A / Option B", I choose a name that describes the option, eg. "The Slack Integration / The Manual Email Send". This makes it easier when it comes to step 7, socialising and getting feedback.

### 4. Compare the options against the criteria

Once I have my options and my criteria, and I've spent some time describing them and their boundaries, I start the comparison.

I create a table that has the options on one axis (usually the columns) and the criteria on the other (usually the rows). I aim to make it really visually clear and easy to compare options.

I usually include Pros and Cons rows as a starting point, as a way to describe the opinions I may have already formulated, and to catch considerations that fall outside of the key criteria. However, the main evaluation should be against the key criteria.

### 5. Investigate gaps as necessary

Once I start filling in the table, it usually becomes clear where the gaps are, and this is where I would usually employ a time-boxed [Spike](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spike_(software_development)>) to give enough of an answer to evaluate.

I try to be pragmatic about how much depth I go into with filling out the table. Sometimes it's clear that filling a gap in the table won't make a difference to the selection, because other criteria have ruled it out, so I fill it out to a lower fidelity.

### 6. Develop a recommendation

Once the table is sufficiently filled out, I usually have enough information to make a recommendation. I try to be clear about which option I recommend and why, and sometimes I might provide secondary recommendations, for instance which option might be a follower, or which option to avoid.

When I have my recommendation, I make sure that it's clear which is the recommendation in my document - both in the description and in the table. I will use labels and colours to describe this.

Even if I'm not the final decision maker, I think it's important that I make a recommendation because:

- I have the most context, having done the research
- I want to exercise my critical thinking muscles, and ensure that I test my biases
- It makes the decision maker's job easier

### 7. Socialise with stakeholders

I usually do parts of this step throughout the process, for instance through pairing with a team member or a subject matter expert from the start, when I'm investigating gaps, or when I need help coming up with my recommendation.

When I have a recommendation, I think it's important to make sure that those that are affected by the decision have time to review the analysis and provide feedback. I know I'll probably miss things, and I want to make sure I consider their input. That said, I will always set a timeframe in which to provide feedback, so that the work can still move forward.

When I've received feedback, I make sure to update my analysis with reference to the feedback, and if necessary, amend my recommendation.
