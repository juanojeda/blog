This is my summary and review of [Marty Cagan's "Product Ops Overview" article](https://www.svpg.com/product-ops-overview/), from December 20, 2021.
In this article, Cagan outlines 6 different "shapes" that Product Ops can take in an organisation.

I'm reviewing and summarising so that I can learn from it.

## TL;DR &ndash; My key takeaways
- The article reads like a summary of the dysfunctions of a Product Ops implementation within organisations.
- Cagan points out what to look out for in a Product Ops capability, and how to avoid the pitfalls. Some of these seem fairly easy to fall into!
- The final model he talks about (the Force Multiplier model), which he credits to Melissa Perri, sounds most like what I envisioned Product Ops to be, especially with the initial definition he gives of "empowering product managers to do good work".
- I definitely need to read more into Melissa Perri's work, especially her book [Escaping the Build Trap](https://www.amazon.com.au/Escaping-Build-Trap-Melissa-Perri/dp/149197379X). I've added this to my reading list.

## Why is it hard to define?

Cagan says that it's hard to define the Product Ops role because it operates differently at different organisations. While it could be considered analogous to Dev Ops, which he defines[^1] as:

> tools and technology to empower engineers to accelerate their code into production

it's not quite the same. Product Management, Cagan says, relies less on tooling and technology[^2] so the analogy isn't quite right.

Cagan gives a very broad and general function of Product Ops to be "empowering product managers to do good work". But what this looks like is different at various companies.

In his overview, he breaks down 6 different models from the companies trying to be the best. He shows that a company saying "We have Product Ops" is fairly meaningless at this time.

## Cagan's 6 models of Product Ops
#### Reincarnated PMO model
This model is characterised by Product Ops being in charge of planning activities:
	- Strategic initiatives
	- Roadmapping
	- Portfolios
	
They are responsible for procedures and governance around Product Management, ensuring a unified lifecycle. Requests from stakeholders are managed through Product Ops, and they manage timelines and deliverables.

PMO stands for Program Management Office. Cagan sees this as a Command/Control style of management, and uses the SAFe model as an example of this. As PMO style management was superceded by Agile practices, Cagan hypothesises that this model of Product Operations is a way for more traditional CEOs to bring back this kind of predictability and control.
He also points out that it's a slippery slope from this model of Product Operations to becoming what Amazon describes as a [Day 2 organisation](https://aws.amazon.com/executive-insights/content/how-amazon-defines-and-operationalizes-a-day-1-culture/):
	- Organisations slow down as they scale
	- They focus on their operating model rather than on their customer
	- Their innovation slows down, then stops
	- Their product and brand becomes irrelevant to customers

The PMO model doesn't define itself around the customer, but around predictability of output.

#### Two-in-a-box PM model
Cagan provides a deeper dive into this model [here](https://www.svpg.com/two-in-a-box-pm/). This model splits the work of Product into two categories:
	- building the thing, and
	- the day to day tasks involved with building the thing

In the first category is the product decisions and strategy. In the second category is all the prep and communication that goes along with it. Cagan sees this as another iteration of similar Product/assistant splits, such as PM + BA, PM+PO, inbound PM + outbound PM, PM + jr PM etc.

He posits that this model arises from the idea that the work involved for a PM is too much for one person (which is not something he disagrees with, but he points out that there are other places to cut from).

He defines three key criteria required for a PM to do their job effectively[^3]:
	- Direct access to users / customers
	- Direct access to business stakeholders
	- Direct access to engineers / designers

The Two-in-a-Box model attempts to distribute these three responsibilities between two people. When the PM loses one of these responsibilities, they lose their ability to make good Product decisions.

Cagan makes a concession for companies that have data analysts, customer researchers, dev ops, sales ops etc, to help answer Product-related questions, so long as the PM owns the decisions.

#### Delegated Product Leader model
This model places the focus of Product Ops on skill uplift of the Product capability. Cagan draws a parallel with the purpose of a product manager[^4].
This model, according to Cagan, aims to fill the vacuum of product leadership with Product Ops, to do the coaching and strategy for them. The leadership aspects of Product. Specifically with the strategy, having a role whose job is the strategy while the Product Manager is in the day-to-day creates a similar disconnect as the Two-in-a-Box model:
	- The Product Ops person is disconnected from the day-to-day discovery
	- They are also not close enough to the Product teams to have rapport or respect

The risk that Cagan points out is that when Product Leaders don't take personal ownership of their teams' skills, the skills waste away, creating weak Product teams.
#### Production Operations Rebranding model
To describe this model, Cagan uses the example of a product (The Guardian's "Eyewitness" product) that involves a high amount of coordination to continue running. In this model, the Product Ops role is there to handle the "production operations" of the product, literally being the glue that keeps the product running[^5].

Having this role is a compromise between investing in automation of these operations, and having the product simply fall apart. Potentially the reason that this model exists is to keep make the role more appealing to a changing market, appropriating the branding of "Product Ops" to make it attractive (see below also).
#### Product Marketing Manager Rebranding model
In this model, the Prod Ops role is covering some of the core support functions of Product, including:
	- product marketing
	- product support[^6]
	- Sales operations

As with the previous model, the reason for this model's existence could be that the name of Product Ops is shiny enough to attract and retain talent. The same risk of mislabelling applies to both models &ndash; in future roles, the candidate may struggle to show actually relevant experience in their next Product Ops role. There's another risk that there may be tension with the marketing team, whose role shares a big overlap here.

#### The Force Multiplier model
This model is the model proposed by Melissa Perri in her Product Ops book - [Escaping the Build Trap](https://www.amazon.com.au/Escaping-Build-Trap-Melissa-Perri/dp/149197379X)[^7]. Cagan is up front in saying that he prefers this model, and hopes it's the definition that sticks.
The model defines three pillars of the Product Ops capability:
	- Quantitative Insights
	- Qualitative Insights
	- Tools & Best Practices Evangelism

**Quant. Insights** is essentially the data science team. It's about having a single source of truth about your product and customer behaviour rather than many different interpretations. Putting this in the Prod Ops capability puts data at the centre of Product decisions, and gives Product people "permission" to use those resources, which might otherwise be off limits.

**Qualitative Insights** is basically the Customer / User research team. The same trick applies â€“ by putting this in the Product Ops team, customer insights become part of the decision process.

Cagan points out that both of these pillars need to act like enablement teams, that focus on best practices, tooling, infrastructure. He reiterates the need for these functions as helping Product make informed decisions, not to make those decisions for them.

The **Tools and Best Practices** pillar is a critical one, which if not implemented well, can send it all sideways, according to Cagan. To me, this pillar seems like the "Delegated Product Leader" model on the surface, but it's not about taking away the strategy or training aspect &ndash; It's about providing an example and providing the tools and practices to make it easier.

[^1]: I don't know if I agree with this definition. I think Dev Ops is more akin to the Force Multiplier model (described below), in that it is about reducing friction for engineers, sometimes through tooling, but also through decision making data, best practices, and training.

[^2]: So what is Product Management about? I have a general idea, but this is something to dig into in another lesson

[^3]: I think I would relate these to being able to make decisions about Desirability, Viability and Feasibility

[^4]: My colleague Dan Prager pointed out that this is not a universal model or purpose of a manager, but is sometimes referred to as the Servant Leader model.

[^5]: I might liken this to a Producer, which I had experience with in my Agency days

[^6]: I have one issue with this model: Is customer service & support really part of marketing, or part of product?

[^7]: I'm definitely adding this into my study plan
