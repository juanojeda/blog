Over the past few months, working at the current client has made me realise a couple of things:
1. I am really interested in the field of Product and Product Operations, and
2. I know very little about the field of Product and Product Operations

In order to help me get a better understanding of what Product Ops is, what "good" Product Ops looks like, and how I can get involved in it, I've come up with a rough study plan. I haven't really studied in a long time, at least in any kind of structured way, so I expect this will be a challenge and that the plan will evolve as I go.

The plan at this point is to answer the following questions:
- What are the common definitions for Product Ops?
- What are the core concepts of Product Ops?
- How do the core concepts of Product Ops relate to each other? (diagrams, maps, processes etc)

I have some fuzzier questions around how it is applied, and what the tools/techniques/methods look like, but these can come later.
