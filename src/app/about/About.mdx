Hello, I'm Juan. I am a food fanatic, music enthusiast, TTRPG nerd, and pawrent to Popcorn, the best good girl around.

### Work, software, and teams

During business hours, I do a lot of things, but mostly I help teams deliver value to their customers. Sometimes that means designing digital products or experiences, other times it means writing code (usually for UI in Typescript, but some companies have trusted me to work on their APIs too). Often it means helping teams understand their customers and each other.

I'm passionate about building high-performing teams that care for each other, and focus on delivering value to the customer quickly and sustainably. I strongly believe that the team is the smallest unit of delivery, and that means focusing on people, vision and process.
